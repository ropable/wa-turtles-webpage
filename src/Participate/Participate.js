                We run two monitoring programs each year, which provide
                opportunities for volunteers to get involved with and learn more
                about the program.
                <h3>Thevenard Island</h3>
                <h4>Accommodation</h4>
                <p>
                  Thevenard Island is one of the Mackerel Islands, a group of 10
                  islands off the coast of Onslow, WA. The island is accessed by
                  a 45-minute boat trip. Staff and volunteers will stay at fully
                  self-contained cabins. Cabins have two to five bedrooms with
                  two single beds in each bedroom, so staff and volunteers will
                  be expected to share. When possible, gender specific rooms
                  will be allocated.

                <p>
                  Volunteers will help with research on flatback turtles. Duties
                  will include:
                </p>
                Patrolling the beach at night for nesting turtles; tagging;
                measuring; taking skin biopsy; deploying satellite tags;
                patrolling the beach and counting tracks during the day;
                monitoring nesting success and hatching success; data entry.
                <p>
                  Shifts will vary due to tides, the number of turtles on the
                  beach and the number of staff/volunteers available, however
                  volunteers should expect long hours working under difficult
                  conditions (approximately 5-8 hours per night).
